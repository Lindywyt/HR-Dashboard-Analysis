## Introduction:
---
HR Analytics, also known as Human Resources Analytics or People Analytics, involves the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data to inform data-driven decisions in GreenTech Innovation. This process provides insights into various aspects of human resource management, including employee performance, recruitment, retention, engagement, and talent development. By leveraging HR Analytics, organizations can optimize HR strategies and align them with their overall goals and objectives. Despite its impressive 15-year history and leadership in the renewable energy sector, GreenTech Innovation faces critical human resources challenges that need to be addressed. This project aims to analyze key metrics such as employee performance, engagement, and growth. Additionally, it will explore how deficiencies in these areas could impact GreenTech Innovation’s business growth.

## Problem Statement
---
- Investigate employee engagement based on factors such as education qualification, age range, gender, marital status, recruitment source, and department.
- Examine the evolution of employee engagement over time.
- Determine whether a correlation exists between engagement and satisfaction, along with other variables.
- Explore employee performance in relation to education qualification, age range, gender, marital status, and department.
- Analyze how employee performance changes over time.
- Investigate whether a correlation can be established between performance and engagement, as well as other variables.

## Data Sourcing

The data was provided by AMDARI. To clean, analyse, and visualise the data, I imported the CSV file that I had downloaded into Power Bi.

## Data Transformation/Cleaning: 

Using Power BI's power query editor, a date table was created, and the dataset was effectively cleaned and transformed.

## Data Modelling: 

On the Power BI model view, a relationship was built between the HR dataset and the date table.

## Recommendation
---
- Provide additional help or chances for employees with lesser educational credentials to increase their engagement and performance, as they currently score lower than those with higher degrees.
  
- Investigate the effect of varied staff support on engagement and performance. Consider giving assistance for women in different marital statuses, as this may contribute to increased engagement and performance.
  
- Examine the efficacy of various surveys with an emphasis on increasing participation. Consider investing more in surveys with greater engagement scores, such as Do Not Use Appraisals.

- Explore the varying performance of older employees. A broad age range of longstanding employees suggests varying degrees of engagement. Giving opportunities to older employees to share their experiences and struggles is recommended.
  
- Leverage the high performance of employees with 7 and 10 years of service. Retention strategies or career development opportunities can be developed to train and further enhance the performance of these employees.
  
- Learn from the Admin Office desk team, which had the highest performance scores; this desk provides clear deliverables to improve overall performance rates.
